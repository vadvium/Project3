# Project3
I used the US Census Bureau website to find data about the median income in 2015 [MEDIAN INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2015)]
I was able to outer merge the data to the dataset from my project in order to see if student's income can affect their average SAT score. My hypothesis is that if a family has a higher income, they can spend money on tutors to better their grades.
